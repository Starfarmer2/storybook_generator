# Getting Started

The app can currently be tested using Expo by installing the Expo Go mobile app. After you have Expo Go installed on your mobile device, in your computer terminal, do the following steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/ben594/storybook_generator.git
cd storybook_generator/frontend
```

After installing yarn, or if you already have yarn installed, run:
```
yarn # installs dependencies
yarn start
```

The terminal will display a QR code and several options, such as to run the app in an iOS simulator on your computer.

With the Expo Go mobile app installed on your mobile device, you can also scan the QR code and directly start using the app!
